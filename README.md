#3D "Engine"

3D "Engine" made with C++ using OpenGL.

This project is currently unusable by anyone other than me but feel free to mess around with it.

To see what it does just compile and run main.cpp program, just make sure you've got the right dependencies, mainly freeglut so far. (I've setup an easy way to do it on linux, just do bash build.sh)
